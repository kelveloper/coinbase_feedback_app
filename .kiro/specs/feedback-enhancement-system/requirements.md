# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Feedback Enhancement System transforms fragmented, multi-channel customer feedback data into a unified, strategically-aware dataset. This system processes raw feedback from four distinct sources (Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Twitter/X, and Internal Sales Notes) and creates a single master CSV file with standardized schema, AI-driven insights, and strategic alignment. The enhanced dataset enables data-driven decision-making by providing consistent structure, sentiment analysis, and strategic goal mapping across all feedback channels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to load and process multiple CSV feedback sources, so that I can work with all customer feedback data in a unified format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes input files THEN it SHALL successfully load all four CSV sources: coinbase_advance_apple_reviews.csv, coinbase_advanceGoogle_Play.csv, coinbase_advanced_twitter_mentions.csv, and coinbase_advance_internal_sales_notes.csv
2. WHEN loading fails for any file THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which file failed and why
3. WHEN all files are loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain separate DataFrames for each source during processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want standardized column mapping across all data sources, so that I can work with consistent field names and data types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing Apple and Google reviews THEN the system SHALL map customer_id to feedback_id, review_text to feedback_text, and helpful_votes to source_metric
2. WHEN processing Twitter mentions THEN the system SHALL map customer_id to feedback_id, tweet_text to feedback_text, and followers to source_metric
3. WHEN processing Internal Sales Notes THEN the system SHALL map customer_id to feedback_id, note_text to feedback_text, and ARR_impact_estimate_USD to source_metric
4. WHEN standardizing data THEN the system SHALL create a source_channel column identifying the origin of each feedback record
5. WHEN creating feedback_id values THEN the system SHALL ensure uniqueness by adding appropriate prefixes (apple-, google-, twitter-, sales-)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want AI-driven sentiment scoring and relevance classification, so that I can quantify feedback sentiment and filter for Advanced Trading-related content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing sentiment data THEN the system SHALL convert text-based sentiment to numerical scores: negative = -0.8, neutral = 0.0, positive = 0.7
2. WHEN creating relevance flags THEN the system SHALL set is_relevant to True for all records (assuming all feedback is Advanced Trading related)
3. WHEN sentiment_score is created THEN it SHALL be a float value between -1.0 and 1.0
4. WHEN is_relevant is created THEN it SHALL be a boolean value

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want a unified master dataset with consistent schema, so that I can perform analysis across all feedback channels without data structure concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN combining all sources THEN the system SHALL create a single DataFrame with columns: feedback_id, source_channel, timestamp, feedback_text, source_metric, is_relevant, sentiment_score, theme, strategic_goal
2. WHEN selecting final columns THEN the system SHALL only include the target schema columns and exclude any source-specific fields
3. WHEN the master dataset is created THEN it SHALL contain records from all four input sources
4. WHEN data types are finalized THEN feedback_id and source_channel SHALL be strings, timestamp SHALL be datetime, source_metric and sentiment_score SHALL be floats, and is_relevant SHALL be boolean

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the enhanced dataset exported to CSV format, so that I can use it in downstream analysis tools and share it with stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting the master dataset THEN the system SHALL save it as enriched_feedback_master.csv
2. WHEN saving the CSV THEN the system SHALL exclude the DataFrame index from the output file
3. WHEN the export completes THEN the system SHALL confirm successful file creation
4. WHEN the CSV is created THEN it SHALL be readable by standard CSV processing tools and maintain proper data formatting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and ensure data processing reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file loading fails THEN the system SHALL log specific error details and continue processing available files where possible
2. WHEN data transformation encounters issues THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages with context about which step failed
3. WHEN the process completes successfully THEN the system SHALL log summary statistics including record counts from each source
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL report which data quality checks failed and provide guidance for resolution
